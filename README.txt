·Built a 2-joint planar robotic manipulator that reaches out and picks up light cylindrical 
objects placed in front of it and drops them behind it (on a team of 3).

·We used an ultrasonic sensor to measure the distance to the can and used linear regression 
to develop an equation for how far each of the 2 joints should move, 
in order to be in the right position to pick up the can.

·The robot successfully picked up each soda cans placed in a line, 
picked each of them up in turn, and dropped them behind the robot.
