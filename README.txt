Our task was to build a 2-joint planar robotic manipulator that can reach out and pick up light cylindrical objects placed in front of it and drop them behind it. 
We used an ultrasonic sensor to measure the distance to the can and used linear regression to come up with an equation for how far each of the 2 joints
should move in order to be in the right position to pick up the can.
We were succesfully able to have our robot pick up a line of three soda cans placed in a line, pick each of them up in turn, and drop them behind the robot.
